Testcase 2001

C:\Users\orenr\Documents\SEG 2105\Lloseng\code\simplechat1>java -classpath ..\..\code;. EchoServer
Error: Main method not found in class EchoServer, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application


Comments
---------------------------
Main has been moved to ServerConsole so this does not work as the testcase expects. When EchoServer is
replaced with ServerConsole in the command line, it works as expected:

Comments
---------------------------
The clientConnected() hook method displays info about the new connected client instead of saying that
a new client is attempting to connect to the server.
